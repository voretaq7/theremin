Theremin Construction Notes:

Oscillators
-----------
Using the layout specified the oscillator tanks MUST be shielded as
shown to prevent excessive coupling between the oscillators. Alternate
layouts orienting the oscillator tanks at right angles (as in the 1930s
instruments) or increasing the distance between them reduce the
tendency of the oscillator tanks to couple and may eliminate the need
for shielding.

For flexibility the oscillator cathodes should be grounded using spade
connectors clipped to the pins of the oscillator tank sockets. The
configuration shown on the schematic using the 33% tap point (Pin 5)
is appropriate for a 12AX7 tube and should also work for 12AT7, 12AY7
or 12AU7 tubes. If the tank coil develops excessive voltaeg a lower
tap should be selected.


Mixer Circuit
-------------
Potentiometers between the pitch oscillators and the mixer tube are
identical to values in the Rockmore circuit schematic by Bob Moog.
Values from 25K to 100K were tried and the values in that schematic
give the best ability to vary waveform shape with a typical
(300-degree) potentiometer.
Values up to 100K in both positions may be usable with multi-turn
potentiometers & allow more control however wirewound potentiometers
should be avoided due to inductance effects on the RF signal and
conductive plastic / carbon composition multi-turn potentiometers are
cost-prohibitive.

Grids 1 & 2 of the mixer tube have 1Meg ohm leak resistors connected
to the cathode pin which is grounded directly.
Grid 3 of the mixer tube is connected to the plate to simulate tetrode
operation (emulating a type 24 tetrode) however this may be switched to
ground for pentode operation of the EF86 tube.

The setting of this potentiometer determines the drive level for the
volume stage amplifier. The combination of this plate potentiometer
and the volume stage plate potentiometer will determine the maximum
final output volume.

* As in the RCA/Rosen/Rockmore designs the mixer tube is biased beyond
* cutoff: The negative peaks from the pitch oscillators are sufficient
* to stop the tube from conducting. Overall operation is class AB.
