Theremin Design Notes:

Pitch Oscillators
-----------
Hartley oscillators were chosen in place of the Armstrong oscillators
used in Lev era instruments (RCA, Rockmore, Rosen) mainly for ease
of construction (a single coil tank with multiple taps is easier to
build than the transformer type coils).

The cathode is used to pass signal to the mixer stage as it is least
affected by capacitive loading in the mixer tube. Some harmonic
distortion is evident in the output here.


Mixer Circuit
-------------
As in the RCA/Rosen/Rockmore designs the mixer tube is biased beyond
cutoff: The negative peaks from the pitch oscillators are sufficient
to stop the tube from conducting. Overall operation is between class AB 
or class C. Distortion & harmonic content is similar to RCA theremins
based on waveform diagrams from rcatheremin.com.


The mixer tube is configured with G3 (suppressor grid) connected to
the anode. This connection emulates the Type 24 tetrode used in the
1930s instruments.
Connections to ground (typical pentode operation) and to the G2
(screen grid, VPO) signal were both tried and found to be suboptimal.


Volume Circuit
--------------
Construction of the Lev-era volume circuit which operated by varying
filament voltage to a UX-120 triode is not practical: The UX-120
used a directly-heated cathode, and changing cathode filament voltage
rapidly affected electron output (thus affecting available gain).
The modern production EF86 tube used here has an indirectly heated
cathode which carries more thermal inertia and would not produce
adequate volume response for staccato playing.

Instead the EF86 tube is employed as a voltage-controlled amplifier:
G2 is held at ground potential (slightly negative with respect
to the cathode) and driven positive by the output of the volume
circuit. Staccato response time is determined by the time constant
of the volume buffer capacitor and G2 leak resistor.
