Theremin Design Notes:

Oscillators
-----------
Hartley oscillators were chosen in place of the Armstrong oscillators
used in Lev era instruments (RCA, Rockmore, Rosen) mainly for ease
of construction (a single coil tank with multiple taps is easier to
build than the transformer type coils).

The cathode is used to pass signal to the mixer stage as it appears to
include harmonic content from the oscillators.


Mixer Circuit
-------------
As in the RCA/Rosen/Rockmore designs the mixer tube is biased beyond
cutoff: The negative peaks from the pitch oscillators are sufficient
to stop the tube from conducting. Overall operation is class AB or
class C. Distortion & harmonic content is similar to RCA theremins


Volume Circuit
